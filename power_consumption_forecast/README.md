# Power Consumption Forecast via LSTM Neural Network
> Predict power consumption based on past data using a LSTM sequentila neural net

I have tried to forecast power consumption for one week based on a popular [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) of historical power consumption measurements. For the forecast I have used a sequential LSTM neural network.
This has resulted in a reasonalby accurate forecast with a relatively low RMSE.
