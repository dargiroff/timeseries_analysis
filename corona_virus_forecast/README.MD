# Covid19 Data Analysis & Forecast
> An analysis of the growth of the confirmed covid19 cases and timeseries forecast

I have used the [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv)
data in order to make a visual analysis of the growth of the confirmed covid19 cases,
as well as make a prediction about that growth.

<br>

For the analysis of the growth I have graphed the cumulative cases per country, for 30 days after the 100th case in the
respective country. I have highlighted some countries of interest and have compared their growth paths with the 33% growth
rate. The resulting figure gives interesting insight about the development of the pandemic. Namely, in many western 
countries the growth of the confirmed cases has been comparable to a daily growth of 33%, which could be interpreted as
a sign that many other countries might soon be facing the challenges Ð¾f Italy. However, in countries such as Singapore,
Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea, the growth has been reduced by the use of a set of rapid and strict measures, such as
mass testing, social distancing, and tracking of potential virus carriers, among others.

For the forecast of the daily covid19 cases, I have used [Holt-Winter's exponential smoothing technique](https://otexts.com/fpp2/holt-winters.html). <br>
Via a grid search, I have found the best hyperparams for the exponential smoothing and have backtest the forecast on
a training set that constitutes 33% of the available data.
After the backtest I have used all available data to make a prediction in the future.
